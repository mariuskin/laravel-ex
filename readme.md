# LGParking Application

This a Lithuanian Railway Parking application developed using Laravel PHP framework version 5.2(Important!). The plugin used during the project was CRUD-Generator. The random data generation was done using famous, already built-in Laravel's functionality: Faker.

## Laravel PHP Framework v.5.2

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
